# SciFigureTemplates

A set of Adobe Illustrator *.ait template files for easily creating figures in several journals, mostly related to my field of condensed matter physics. Each template contains: boxes with each journal's specific size constraints; the preferred font label and style; and extra information pertinent to each journal (RGB/CMYK, minimum line thickness, etc). A hyper-link to the journal's figure information is included as well as a date with the latest revision.

I cannot state this enough, *USE THESE TEMPLATES AT YOUR OWN RISK*. I am not responsible for delays in your publication if information is incorrect and/or out-dated. Creating the templates is very easy, so...make your own! I have a series of [YouTube videos](https://tiny.cc/illustr8) on how to create figures using Adobe Illustrator.

One extra word of caution: Journal's may state that they prefer CMYK, which means your figure may look different when posted online (usually RGB). It may sometimes be better to purposely aim for maximizing it's appearance on the web versus print.
